# Learning about Red Team Fundamentals  
*There are teams in the CyberSecurity world. Which one are you on?*  
We all already are aware of the different Hats in the cyber security world.  
* Black Hat Hackers ~ Illegal Hackers  
* White Hat Hackers ~ Legal Hackers  
* Grey Hat Hackers ~ Legal during day, Illegal by night.  
However, as we dawn into the newer ages of Cyber Security, we need to be aware of the teams that are in place.  
Basically teams works just like Football.  
**Read Team** ~ Offensive Security = They try to hack into the given target with the set directions.  
**Blue Team** ~ Deffensive Security = This team will do what ever they can to prevent the Red Team from gaining access.  
**White Team** ~ Middle Man = Basically, they are the refs of the Cyber War Game!  
  
## T.H.M. Red Team Fundamentals  
We can all access this course [here](https://tryhackme.com/room/redteamfundamentals)! I have put the notes & copied virtually everything inside of the RedTeamFundamentals.md file so that you can follow along.  
I did the copy/paste of the entire course for my own personal gain. Why?  
I have the room pulled up on 1 monitor, and wanted to read the information on my second monitor.
